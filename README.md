HFT-CLI
=======

Command line utilities for [HappyFunTimes](http://greggman.github.io/HappyFunTimes).

Installation
------------

If you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and npm installed

    npm install -g hft-cli

You probably want a `sudo` in front of that. I have no idea why it people list it without `sudo`.

I'll try to add native installers eventually.
